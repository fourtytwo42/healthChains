# Avatar Images

Place your avatar images here:

- **fred-avatar.png** - AI assistant avatar (Fred)
- **user-avatar.png** - User avatar (will show user's initial if image not found)

Both images should be:
- PNG format
- Square aspect ratio (recommended: 512x512px or larger)
- Will be displayed as round avatars in the chat interface

If images are not found, the chat will display a fallback with the first letter of the name.
